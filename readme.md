syrinx (as in syrinx.gilesb.com)
================================

Syrinx (named after the aspect of avian anatomy which
enables birds to sing) is an attempt at Twitter filtering,
summarization, and aggregation. Its goal is to act as a drama
[firebreak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firebreak), a redundancy
eliminator, an automatically-generated "best of" album, and an aid to
concentration and productivity.
