syrinx (as in syrinx.gilesb.com)
================================

Syrinx (named after the aspect of avian anatomy which
enables birds to sing) is an attempt at Twitter filtering,
summarization, and aggregation. Its goal is to act as a drama
[firebreak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firebreak), a redundancy
eliminator, an automatically-generated "best of" album, and an aid to
concentration and productivity.

weird design
============

This system uses `ActiveRecord` but does not follow Rails
conventions about how to use it. This is partly because it
isn't a Rails app, but mainly because I wanted to experiment
with the design style shown in the Destroy All Software
['Sucks/Rocks'](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/sucks-rocks-1-the-rails-app)
series of screencasts.
